# lua-libExpand
 
This is a collection of functions I compiled together to expand on the default Lua libraries. It's meant to be easy to add to your Lua projects such as LÃ–VE. It's recommended to use the Lua extension in Visual Studio Code for tips on what each function does, otherwise it will be a comment in the files themselves.

Functions I pull from elsewhere will be linked below:
* From [Mari0: AE](https://github.com/alesan99/mari0_ae)
    * `math.clamp`
    * `string.split`
    * `table.contains`
    * `table.find`
